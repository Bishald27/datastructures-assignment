It's a highly efficient way to store and retrieve data in the form of key-value pairs. The core idea behind a hash table is to use a hash function to map keys to indices in an array, allowing for very fast lookups. When you want to store a key-value pair, the key is passed through a hash function. This function takes the key as input and computes an integer, called a hash value (or hash code). A good hash function will produce different hash values for different keys and distribute these values uniformly."

        "- By Value (Membership Testing): When you check if a specific value exists in a list (e.g., value in my_list), Python has to iterate through the list, comparing the target value with each element one by one, until a match is found or the end of the list is reached.\n",

        "Retrieval Mechanism:\n",
        "- By Key: When you retrieve a value using its key (e.g., my_dict[key]), Python uses a hash table internally.It first calculates a hash value (a unique integer) for the key you provided.This hash value then directly points to a specific \"bucket\" or memory location within the dictionary's internal storage where that key-value pair should reside.Python goes directly to that location to retrieve the associated value.\n",
